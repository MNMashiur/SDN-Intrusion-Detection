# SDN-Intrusion-Detection
Machine Learning–Based Intrusion Detection System for Software-Defined Networks (SDN) using the InSDN dataset. This project evaluates multiple supervised ML models and ensemble techniques to detect SDN-specific cyberattacks, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization through careful preprocessing, feature selection, and model comparison.
